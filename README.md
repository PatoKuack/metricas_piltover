## Description.
A page to obtain the personal statistics of a video game called League of Legends.
The page asks for the player's name and since it is expected that most users are Latino, the other 3 configurations are predefined. The profile is verified and the data of the games is loaded with two buttons. Finally, the menu is displayed and the "Statistics" section opens.
The statistics have two graphs that are SVG that are dynamically updated with the data of the champion that is selected, it also has numerical data on maximums, percentages and totals (for example, the total hours played with the champion)

### The hardest thing for me was...
Using Riot's API key (the creator of LoL) since it doesn't allow me to use the API key from another file, I couldn't use Axios or environment variables. I have to register the project to avoid those errors, but I don't know how long the registration will take and while I could not keep the page active.
